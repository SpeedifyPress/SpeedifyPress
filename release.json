This means that no caching will take place until you enable it and update the mode    <\/p>    <h4>Choose the cache lifetime<\/h4>    <p>      This decides how long your cached files will last for being automatically deleted. <i>Never Expires<\/i> is the recommended but it's possible you could run into issues with expired nonce (in which case, set to 6hrs)    <\/p>    <!-- Separate Caches -->    <div>            <h4>Cache Outputs<\/h4>    <\/div>    <h4>Device Paths &amp; Compression<\/h4>    <p>      Allows you to create separate caches for:    <\/p>        <ul>      <li>Mobile users. Use this if mobile users are shown a different site (rather than a responsive site)<\/li>      <li>Cookies<\/li>      <li>Logged in users, by user role. Note that logged in users with the same role will see the same content, unless you use <i>Bypass URLs<\/i> to prevent that or exclude certain page areas from caching.<\/li>    <\/ul>    <p>      Also allows you to force gzipped compressed output if this (or brotli) hasn't already been setup on the server.     <\/p>        <h4>Logged in users (BETA)<\/h4>    <p>      This BETA feature allows you to exclude certain areas from logged-in caching. The options work as follows:    <\/p>           <ul>      <li>Area. Use a CSS selector to define the area or areas of the page not to be cached<\/li>      <li>Skeleton. Area will be hidden with a skeleton while they are loaded in. Choose the skeleton type to use. <\/li>      <li>Delay JS Execution. Selecting this option will ensure that any JS applied to the replacement areas will run properly, as all JS will only run after the swap. Will only work is Delay JS is enabled for the page.<\/li>    <\/ul>        <!-- Filters -->    <div>            <h4>Filters<\/h4>    <\/div>    <h4>Bypass When Cookies Present<\/h4>    <p>      Enter a line seprate list of (partial) cookie names that, if detected, will prevent caching from taking place.

For example, if you're caching logged in users you might want to add <i>my-account<\/i> here    <\/p>                         <h4>Bypass User Agents<\/h4>    <p>       Specify a line separated list of (partial) user agents for which no caching should take place    <\/p>                         <h4>Ignore Querystrings<\/h4>    <p>      Specify a line separated list of querystrings that should be ignored for caching.       For example, to ensure that users arriving from a Klaviyo newsletter all get the cached content <i>nb_klid<\/i> is necessary here.

This means that when the cache is cleared (manually, or after a page update), the next page load will load from the cache but update in the background.       This means users will never get the slower, uncached page BUT you may need to reload a page twice to see the latest version.     <\/p>    <!-- Multiple sites -->    <div>            <h4>Multiple Sites<\/h4>    <\/div>      <p>      This worker will work fine with multiple wordpress sites on the same domain (or subdomains). However, they must all have the same NONCE_SALT defined in wp-config.php. (This should match the this.csrf_salt value defined in the worker, which it should do automatically). To update the NONCE_SALT on your sites, you can manually copy and paste it into the wp-config.php file.      <\/p>        <p>&nbsp;<\/p>    <p>&nbsp;<\/p>    <p>&nbsp;<\/p>    <p>&nbsp;<\/p>  <\/div>\n<h3>How to use the  CSS Settings?<\/h3>\n\n<div>        <!-- Mode Selection -->    <div>            <h4>Mode Selection<\/h4>    <\/div>            <h4>Choose the Unused CSS Mode<\/h4>    <p>      When you first install the plugin, the CSS setting will be set to       <span>Preview Mode<\/span>.

Useful when page content significantly varies across different screen sizes.    <\/p>    <!-- Security -->    <div>            <h4>Security Config<\/h4>    <\/div>    <h4>CSRF Expiry<\/h4>    <p>      This changes the expiry time for the <strong>CSRF nonce<\/strong>. You may need to change this if your host uses their own caching solution and you're not using Cloudflare. In this case, set the expiry value to the same as the host's cache expiry time.     <\/p>            <h4>Force Include Limit<\/h4>    <p>      The maximum number of CSS classes to force include that can be generated per page.

One way to improve things is to host the file locally.                 Ticking this option will download the remote file and setup a cron job to ensure it's always kept up to date.                 This is the recommended method for most sites using GA.             <\/p>            <h4>Preload gtag.js<\/h4>            <p>                Adds a preload in for the locally hosted gtag.js. You won't generally see a performance increase from this, but it can be worth testing.            <\/p>            <h4>Add scripts to Partytown<\/h4>            <p>                 Partytown is an experimental feature that allows you load certain scripts via a web worker and therefore not in the main JavaScript thread.                 It was developed by <a href=\"https:\/\/partytown.builder.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/partytown.builder.io\/<\/a>. To add the locally hosted gtag here, just enter \"local_tag\" to the box.                 This will generally give a performance boost of a few points, but may affect the amount of sessions reported. It's therefore most suited to new sites.             <\/p>        <div>                        <h4>                Images            <\/h4>        <\/div>            <h4>Preload Image<\/h4>            <p>                This is a recommended feature for every site. Adding an image here will activate image lazy loading and set a default image to be displayed before the real image is loaded.                 It's recommended that you choose a very lightweight SVG image here.             <\/p>            <h4>Skip Lazyloading<\/h4>            <p>                Allows you to  skip the lazyloading of certain images. This would normally be for images that are shown above the fold. For example, you should skip lazyloading of your logo.                 Any images that are added here will be preloaded by default.             <\/p>        <div>                        <h4>                Fonts            <\/h4>        <\/div>            <h4>Preload fonts<\/h4>            <p>                This is a recommended feature for every site. It will prevent the flash of unstyled fonts that can happen on page load.             <\/p>            <h4>Don't preload icon fonts<\/h4>            <p>                Recommended for every site. It's generally not necessary to preload these, as they don't flash and the preload can be render blocking.                             <\/p>                        <h4>Only preload fonts on desktop<\/h4>            <p>                Recommended for every site. Font files on mobile are generally too heavy and preloading them will prevent high pagespeed scores.             <\/p>                        <h4>Use system fonts on mobile<\/h4>            <p>                Recommended for every site, in conjunction with \"Only preload fonts on desktop\". Instead of font files, system fonts are used on mobile which is much quicker.             <\/p>                <\/div>\n<h3>How to use the  Javascript Settings?<\/h3>\n\n<div>            <div>                        <h4>                             Defer JavaScript            <\/h4>        <\/div>                    <p>                Ticking the Defer JavaScript textbox will add the <i>defer<\/i> attribute to the script tag. This will defer the loading of the JavaScript until after the DOM has finished parsing (but before the DOM content is ready).                  Try this one first and see what the effect is on page speed.             <\/p>            <h4>Exclude scripts from defer<\/h4>            <p>                Enter any script name or partial script names here to have them excluded from deferring. It will match against the entire script block, including tags such as <i>rel<\/i> and the script contents.                  This can help prevent conflicts with essential scripts.             <\/p>                        <h4>Exclude URLs from defer<\/h4>            <p>                JavaScript will not be deferred on any URLs that match strings or regular expressions entered here.                  Useful for ensuring key functionality remains intact.             <\/p>                    <div>                        <h4>                             Delay JavaScript            <\/h4>        <\/div>            <p>                Ticking the Delay JavaScript textbox will delay the loading of JavaScript until either:            <\/p>            <ul>                <li>The user interacts with the page in any way <\/li>                <li>A certain number of seconds (as configured) elapses <\/li>            <\/ul>              <p>                This is a more aggressive method of deferring JavaScript and can sometimes cause issues with pages, depending on how exactly the JavaScript works.                  For this reason, there are several further options available to configure the way this works:            <\/p>            <h4>Exclude scripts from delay<\/h4>            <p>                Enter any script name or partial script names here to have them excluded from deferring. It will match against the entire script block, including tags such as <i>rel<\/i> and the script contents.                  Useful for scripts that need to run immediately.             <\/p>               <h4>Exclude URLs from delay<\/h4>            <p>                Enter any full or partial URLs here. If matched, no JavaScript delay will take place on that URL.                  Helps avoid breaking key functionality.             <\/p>               <h4>Load JavaScript First<\/h4>            <p>                Enter any script name or partial script names here to bring them to the front of the load order.                  Ideal for high-priority scripts.             <\/p>               <h4>Load JavaScript Last<\/h4>            <p>                Enter any script name or partial script names here to push them to the end of the load order.                  This can improve perceived page speed.             <\/p>               <h4>JavaScript to run on completion<\/h4>            <p>                Enter JavaScript here that should be run after all the scripts have finished loading.                  Enter complete JavaScript with no script tags.            <\/p>                                                       <\/div>\n"
