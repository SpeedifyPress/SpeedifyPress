## How to use the  Cache Settings?

### Mode Selection

#### Choose the Cache Mode

When you first install the plugin, the mode setting will be set to 
      Fully Disabled. 
      This means that no caching will take place until you enable it and update the mode

#### Choose the cache lifetime

This decides how long your cached files will last for being automatically deleted. *Never Expires* is the recommended but it's possible you could run into issues with expired nonce (in which case, set to 6hrs)

### Separate Caches

#### Devices & users

Allows you to create separate caches for:

- Logged in users, by user role. Note that logged in users with the same role will see the same content, unless you use *Bypass URLs* to prevent that.
- Mobile users. Use this if mobile users are shown a different site (rather than a responsive site)

### Filters

#### Bypass When Cookies Present

Enter a line seprate list of (partial) cookie names that, if detected, will prevent caching from taking place. For example:

- üîë *wordpress_logged_in_* ‚Üí Excludes logged-in users.
- üõí *woocommerce_cart_hash* ‚Üí Excludes users with an item in their cart.

#### Bypass URLs

Specify a line separated list of (partial) URLs where no caching should take place. For example, if you're caching logged in users you might want to add *my-account* here

#### Bypass User Agents

Specify a line separated list of (partial) user agents for which no caching should take place

#### Ignore Querystrings

Specify a line separated list of querystrings that should be ignored for caching. 
      For example, to ensure that users arriving from a Klaviyo newsletter all get the cached content *nb_klid* is necessary here. An extensive default list comes with the plugin.
## How to use the  CSS Settings?

### Mode Selection

#### Choose the Unused CSS Mode

When you first install the plugin, the CSS setting will be set to 
      Preview Mode. 
      This allows you to test the plugin as an admin and ensure that unused CSS is removed as expected.

- **Visit some pages** on your site.
- **Scroll and wait** a few seconds on each page.
- Keep [The Dashboard](#) open in another tab.
- Monitor the **Cache Status**‚Äîthe number of files & pages should increase.
- **Revisit the pages**‚Äîthey should now load with optimized CSS.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If not, try clearing your page cache (most caches should update automatically).

#### Choose the Inclusion Method

Decide how your optimized CSS is loaded:

- ‚ö° **Inline CSS:** Inserts all styles at the top of the document, improving Google PageSpeed Insights scores.
- üìÅ **External CSS Files:** Loads individual CSS files, making navigation smoother by caching CSS across multiple pages.

### Filters

#### Force Include Selectors

Use this option to always include specific CSS selectors. If elements lose their styling, it‚Äôs likely because JavaScript dynamically adds the CSS.

- Ensure that **Preview Mode** is enabled.
- Open an incognito tab and visit the same page where styling is incorrect.
- Right-click the affected element and select **Inspect**.
- Find the CSS class responsible for applying the correct styles.
- Add that class to the **Force Include Selectors** list.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Clear the cache and check if the issue is resolved.

#### Force Include URLs

Specify URLs where **no CSS optimization** should occur. Supports **full URLs** and **regular expressions**.

#### Force Ignore Cookies

Exclude CSS processing based on cookie values.  
      Example:

- üîë *wordpress_logged_in_* ‚Üí Excludes logged-in users.
- üõí *woocommerce_cart_hash* ‚Üí Excludes users with an item in their cart.

#### Generation by Screen Resolution

Generates optimized CSS at specific screen resolutions while using the same CSS for all resolutions.  
      Useful when page content significantly varies across different screen sizes.
## How to use the  CSS Stats?

**CSS Stats** provide valuable insights into how CSS is being generated across your site and which plugins contribute to it.

- The **Unused** column shows the number of CSS files generated but **not used** on any page.
- The **Used** column displays the CSS files that are actively in use.
- Click on a row for a **detailed breakdown** of how CSS is applied across your site.

#### By Plugin Folder

View a breakdown of **CSS files generated per üìÇ plugin folder**. This helps identify which plugins contribute the most to your site's styles.

#### By Path

Displays CSS caching stats **for each üîç page path**. This helps pinpoint where CSS is stored and how it's being utilized across different URLs.

#### By Post Types

Groups CSS stats by **üìù Post Type**, allowing you to analyze **which plugins affect different content types**.

- If certain post types **only** fill the **Unused** column, they likely don‚Äôt need those styles‚Äîoptimizing them can improve performance.
## How to use the  Find Replace?

**Find/Replace** is an advanced feature that allows you to directly **search and replace** text in the HTML of all pages on your site.

#### Add Row

Start by clicking **"Add Row"** and entering the text to find and replace.  
            **Important:** Regular expressions are **not supported**, and replacements are **case-sensitive**.

#### Choose Scope

Choose how replacements are applied:

- **Scope: all** ‚Äì Apply the replacement **everywhere** on the page.
- **Scope: first** ‚Äì Replace **only the first occurrence** of the text.
## How to use the  General Settings?

### External Scripts

#### Locally host gtag.js

If you are using the standard Google Analytics tag then this generally results in a performance hit. One way to improve things is to host the file locally. 
                Ticking this option will download the remote file and setup a cron job to ensure it's always kept up to date. 
                This is the recommended method for most sites using GA.

#### Preload gtag.js

Adds a preload in for the locally hosted gtag.js. You won't generally see a performance increase from this, but it can be worth testing.

#### Add scripts to Partytown

üéâ Partytown is an experimental feature that allows you load certain scripts via a web worker and therefore not in the main JavaScript thread. 
                It was developed by [https://partytown.builder.io/](https://partytown.builder.io/). To add the locally hosted gtag here, just enter "local_tag" to the box. 
                This will generally give a performance boost of a few points, but may affect the amount of sessions reported. It's therefore most suited to new sites.

### Images

#### Preload Image

This is a recommended feature for every site. Adding an image here will activate image lazy loading and set a default image to be displayed before the real image is loaded. 
                It's recommended that you choose a very lightweight SVG image here.

#### Skip Lazyloading

Allows you to ‚è© skip the lazyloading of certain images. This would normally be for images that are shown above the fold. For example, you should skip lazyloading of your logo. 
                Any images that are added here will be preloaded by default.
## How to use the  Javascript Settings?

### Defer JavaScript

Ticking the Defer JavaScript textbox will add the *defer* attribute to the script tag. This will defer the loading of the JavaScript until after the DOM has finished parsing (but before the DOM content is ready).  
                Try this one first and see what the effect is on page speed. ‚ö°

#### Exclude scripts from defer

Enter any script name or partial script names here to have them excluded from deferring. It will match against the entire script block, including tags such as *rel* and the script contents.  
                This can help prevent conflicts with essential scripts.

#### Exclude URLs from defer

JavaScript will not be deferred on any URLs that match strings or regular expressions entered here.  
                Useful for ensuring key functionality remains intact.

### Delay JavaScript

Ticking the Delay JavaScript textbox will delay the loading of JavaScript until either:

- The user interacts with the page in any way üñ±Ô∏è
- A certain number of seconds (as configured) elapses ‚è≥

This is a more aggressive method of deferring JavaScript and can sometimes cause issues with pages, depending on how exactly the JavaScript works.  
                For this reason, there are several further options available to configure the way this works:

#### Exclude scripts from delay

Enter any script name or partial script names here to have them excluded from deferring. It will match against the entire script block, including tags such as *rel* and the script contents.  
                Useful for scripts that need to run immediately.

#### Exclude URLs from delay

Enter any full or partial URLs here. If matched, no JavaScript delay will take place on that URL.  
                Helps avoid breaking key functionality. üöß

#### Load JavaScript First

Enter any script name or partial script names here to bring them to the front of the load order.  
                Ideal for high-priority scripts. üéØ

#### Load JavaScript Last

Enter any script name or partial script names here to push them to the end of the load order.  
                This can improve perceived page speed. üöÄ

#### JavaScript to run on completion

Enter JavaScript here that should be run after all the scripts have finished loading.  
                Enter complete JavaScript with no script tags.
